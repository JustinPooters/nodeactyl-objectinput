# âœ¨ nodeactyl-objectinput

This is an add-on to Nodeactyl so that you can use objects as input.<br>
Credits to [Alhassen](https://alhassan.dev/) for this idea.

## Installation

```TEXT
npm i nodeactyl-objectinput
```

## What does this do?

This makes it so that you can use objects as input for Nodeactyl functions. This is **not** a replacement for Nodeactyl, it's just an add-on. Nodeactyl will automatically be installed to your project when nodeactyl-objectinput is installed.

## Heads up!

This package does not yet contain all of the functions that Nodeactyl has. I only created the base so that we can expand it together. I will be adding functions throughout the coming week.

## Disclaimer

With this package, I am not saying that the original Nodeactyl input is bad. It is actually my preferred way of doing things, too. This has only been created as a gift for the community after a conversation in the [Nodeactyl support Discord](https://discord.gg/HvQ4JTqCvs). I respect the Nodeactyl team and what they do for our community.
